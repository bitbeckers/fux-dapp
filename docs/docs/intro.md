# Why FUX?

The froth of the last bull cycle brought a lot of energy and attention to the web3 world. There was an explosion of ideas from seemingly limitless possibilities and backed by abundant capital. Mismanagement of this attention and overcommitment resulted in countless stories of smart and dedicated contributors burning out, over-promising and under-delivering. DAO’s and projects were left with unmanageable timelines and unmet goals. The contributors that fell into this trap were unable to properly account for their attention, carried away by passion and possibilities. The project leaders and communities had no way to assess the bandwidth of the contributors they were placing their faith into. The ecosystem as a whole suffered.

# What is FUX?

Fux Protocol is a tool for individuals and DAO’s that will enable the accounting of attention (bandwidth). The fux flow goes through a commitment stage and then a resolution stage.

In the commitment stage, individuals will commit portions of their attention to workstreams established by DAO’s or projects via the FUX dashboard. This will provide visibility to an individual’s allocation of their bandwidth and a sanity step to prevent over-committing.

DAO’s in general and Workstream owners specifically, will create workstreams and invite collaborators to assign their attention to said workstream. Through the Fux dashboard managers will be able to see the allocation of potential contributors’ attention before entrusting them with their project’s work.

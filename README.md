# FUX dApp

The FUX dApp is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to create and manage workstreams, which represent projects or tasks that require contributions from multiple users. The Dapp is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts and the Next.js framework for the frontend.

## What is FUX?

The FUX dApp is part of the FUX Protocol, which is a decentralized workstream protocol that allows users to create and manage workstreams, contribute to workstreams, and receive acknowledgement in the form of vFUX tokens. FUX tokens are ERC-1155 tokens that represent the value of work done by contributors in a workstream. The FUX Protocol is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications.The fux flow goes through a commitment stage and then a resolution stage.

In the commitment stage, individuals will commit portions of their attention to workstreams established by DAO’s or projects via the FUX dashboard. This will provide visibility to an individual’s allocation of their bandwidth and a sanity step to prevent over-committing.

DAO’s in general and Workstream owners specifically, will create workstreams and invite collaborators to assign their attention to said workstream. Through the Fux dashboard managers will be able to see the allocation of potential contributors’ attention before entrusting them with their project’s work.
